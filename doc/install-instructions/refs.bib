  abstract = {The process-oriented event-driven transaction systems (POETS) architecture
	introduced by Henglein et al. is a novel software architecture for
	enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. POETS employs a pragmatic
	separation between (i) transactional data, that is what has happened;
	(ii) reports, that is what can be derived from the transactional
	data; and (iii) contracts, that is which transactions are expected
	in the future. Moreover, POETS applies domain-specific languages
	(DSLs) for specifying reports and contracts, in order to enable succinct
	declarative specifications as well as rapid adaptability and customisation.
	In this report we document an implementation of a generalised and
	extended variant of the POETS architecture. The generalisation is
	manifested in a detachment from the ERP domain, which is rather an
	instantiation of the system than a built-in assumption. The extensions
	amount to a customisable data model based on nominal subtyping; support
	for run-time changes to the data model, reports and contracts, while
	retaining full auditability; and support for referable data that
	may evolve over time, also while retaining full auditability as well
	as referential integrity. Besides the revised architecture, we present
	the DSLs used to specify data definitions, reports, and contracts
	respectively, and we provide the complete specification for a use
	case scenario, which demonstrates the conciseness and validity of
	our approach. Lastly, we describe technical aspects of our implementation,
	with focus on the techniques used to implement the tightly coupled
	DSLs.}
